# How to order IBM Cloud Direct Link Exchange
{: # how-to-order-ibm-cloud-direct-link-exchange}

1. Verify your network provider's capabilities to reach the appropriate IBM Cloud PoP. 
2. Use the [IBM Cloud console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com) to open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Direct Link Exchange request and complete the requested information. (Assistance from IBM sales engineers can be requested.) If you use the Equinix provider, you can use [automated ordering](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link?topic=direct-link-provisioning-ibm-cloud-direct-link-exchange-for-equinix).
3. Contact your Exchange provider and negotiate connectivity to your Colocation
4. Order a "virtual circuit" through the Exchange provider, and refer the Ticket ID of the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} Direct Link request as your "Request ID" or "Authorization ID"
5. IP assignment on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} networking infrastructure will be completed within 3 business days after the virtual circuit request is complete.
